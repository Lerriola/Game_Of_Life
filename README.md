#Game Of Life

The Game of Life is a simple cellular automaton simulation that was devised by mathematician Jhon Horton Conway in 1970. 
Conway recently died due to Covid-19, so I decided to implement his game with pygame. Conway was an awesome mathematician, appart from his extensive contributions to game theory he has appeared in many videos of numberphile wich is a great youtube channel I follow.

The code is partly inspired on a youtube video by Dot Csv.

#Game Instructions

In this repo you can find the python script for the game plus an already compiled .exe executable.
Once you have executed the game either executing the .exe file or running it as a .py file, in wich case you will have to pre-install pygame and numpy libraries if you haven't already.

Press any key to stop and draw with your mouse by cliking wherever you want and then press any key again to make the cells interact with each other.
