# Game Of Life

The Game of Life is a simple cellular automaton simulation that was devised by mathematician Jhon Horton Conway in 1970. 
Conway recently died due to Covid-19, so I decided to implement his game with pygame. Conway was an awesome mathematician, appart from his extensive contributions to game theory he has appeared in many videos of numberphile wich is a great youtube channel I follow.

The code is partly inspired on a youtube video by Dot Csv.


# Set Up

In order to execute this file you will need python, which will likely come pre-installed in most linux distributions.
You will also need Pygame which doesn't come pre-installed.
To install Pygame simple run the following comand on your terminal:

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

The --user flag indicates python to install Pygame into the home directory rather than globaly.


Once you've installed Pygame simply executed as a python file:

```
python GameOfLife.py
```

The game interface should appear now.
Enjoy!

# Game Instructions

You can draw blocs on the grid simply by leftclicking on them. In order to draw a set of them you have to press any key on the keybord and the game will stop, then you will be able to draw as many blocs as you want.
